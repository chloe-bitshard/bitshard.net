<p class="intro-paragraph drop-cap-de-zs">
I have had a pretty fortunate run at a single developer over my career.  The common advice is to frequently look at new opportunities in tech to improve your situation.   I wish I had followed that advice a little more earlier in my career.</p>

In 2021, I began taking my job, and salary, a bit more seriously.  The stress of work had become overwhelming, and I decided to look elsewhere.  I hadn't expected to be offered almost double what I was currently being paid everywhere I looked.  I quit my job, expecting to move on to a new company.  Instead, I was offered a promotion and a raise to stay.  I accepted, and I'm glad I did.  Along with the promotion and raise were some guarantees around severance and an expectation that the demands being placed on me would decrease, rather than increase.  I'm glad I stayed, but I'm also glad I looked.  I'm not sure I would have been able to negotiate the raise I received without the knowledge of what I was worth elsewhere.

I'm sharing my salary history here to help others in the same situation.
