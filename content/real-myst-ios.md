Summary: Traversal by tapping and holding to move forward, and moving your finger to control the look direction sucks.  I think it would be tedious to the point that it would exacerbate anything I might hope to gain by considering whether first person movement exacerbates difficulties w/r/t pixel hunting.

Beyond the above, I did like that you could bookmark locations and images from within the game, in a fairly minimal fashion.  I don’t think that’s required in a world where screenshots are pervasive, but I still appreciate anything that can improve the tools to play.
