Summary: I was excitedly anticipating the release of Street Fighter 6.  While I was expecting to play using the new Modern controls, I’ve found myself defaulting to using Classic controls with almost every character.

I started playing Street Fighter (and fighting games in general) seriously with Street Fighter 4.  I had taken StarCraft II seriously, and had enjoyed the learning process.

I mained Ryu in SF4, and learned the basics.  I didn’t keep up with Street Fighter when V was released.  The state of the game at launch, along with a busy work schedule had me drop fighting games for the past generation of fighters.

Early in the pandemic, I picked up GranBlue Fantasy Versus.  I had fun with it, but I soon found myself at the bottom of the rankings and found it difficult to find games.

Other than that, I’ve noodled with Them’s Fightin’ Herds and Tekken 7 over the past couple years, but no fighter has as firmly placed its jaws in me as Street Fighter 6.
