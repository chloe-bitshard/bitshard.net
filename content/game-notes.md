Summary: Game Notes on this site are not traditional reviews.  Instead, they are thoughts on my personal experiences and what I found enjoyable.  They are meant to accurately describe my experiences with games.  Most game notes will be written about games I don’t finish, since I don’t finish every game.

One of the main struggles I have when thinking about art is that I don’t spend enough time considering the specific things I’m enjoying (and disliking) about games.  I want to use these notes as a log of what I’m playing, what I like, and what makes me drop a game.
