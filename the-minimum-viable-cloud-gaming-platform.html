wants to compete in the cloud gaming space.  If you can make a great experience<sup id="sf-the-minimum-viable-cloud-gaming-platform-6-back"><a href="#sf-the-minimum-viable-cloud-gaming-platform-6" class="simple-footnote" title="Big if.">6</a></sup>, you can lock them into using your platform.  Cloud Gaming changes the playing field for creating games.</p>
<p>Historically, console-makers lock users into their ecosystem through many-hundred-dollar games systems every five or six years.  Each upgrade promises new possibilities in gaming.</p>
<p>Outline:</p>
<ol>
<li>Historical Moats</li>
<li>Console<ul>
<li>Large improvements in each generation (up through the PS4/Xbox One).</li>
<li>Lock into console, stuck with one set of games.</li>
<li>Leads to lots of obsessive children who love one platforms mostly because it's what they have.  (Link to Chris Remo song).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Current state of this lockin might be changing:<ul>
<li>Price of consoles over time compared to inflation.</li>
<li>Price of games over time compared to inflation.</li>
<li>Gamepass</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Promise of Game Streaming as it has been pitched to date.</li>
<li>No/Cheap Console -- Just a controller? (Stadia)</li>
<li>Hardware upgrades happen at the server/vendor level.  Never need to upgrade again.</li>
<li>Play from anywhere.  Phone, laptop, tv.  Like Netflix or any other streaming platform.  Ubiquitous platforms.</li>
<li>The issues.</li>
<li>'Gamers' aren't stoked about latency; non-gamers will not notice for most games.</li>
<li>So your target market for a new gaming platform is non-gamers.  It seems like a stretch to think that non-gamers are going to pay anything for a games platform when free phone games are probably good enough for most non-gamers.  Not many people who don't own a console is looking to get one, even at a vastly reduced price.  These people might love games if they tried, but they aren't going to spend <em>any</em> money for this, and in most cases you need a controller.</li>
<li>No gamers are going to be praising these devices, so non-gamers thinking about dipping their toes into games will not hear good things about cloud platforms when asking the 'experts' even if they are the best option for the particular person.</li>
<li>The latency issue</li>
<li>The bandwidth issue</li>
<li>Making Cloud Gaming appeal to Core gamers.</li>
<li>Exclusives are how you build any new games company.  They are integral to bringing core gamers to your platform.</li>
<li>Exclusives on Cloud Gaming Platforms will be percieved to be downgrades, and gamers will wait for PC releases, or forego the game all together unless the latency issue is solved.  Games without demanding requirements w/r/t latency should be prioritized unless you can be certain you've cracked the latency issue.</li>
<li>Cloud Gaming Platforms must create exclusives that are only possible on Cloud Gaming.</li>
<li>New Frontiers</li>
<li>Games Consoles rate of technological advancement has slowed dramatically in the past decade.  Gaming platforms have matured.</li>
<li>Cloud Gaming offers some new opportunities others can never meet.</li>
<li>High-user-count real time gaming.</li>
<li>Servers with lots of players should be easier to coordinate when all game clients are on the same intranet.  Moving the latency pipeline out of the game/server loop allows for games that were not previously possible.</li>
<li>Large-client games.</li>
<li>console storage size is becoming an issue.  Games are 100+ GB and growing.  This makes keeping multiple games on a console painful.  If companies really do want to keep pushing the size, for good reason, then maybe this is a way they can pull it off.  Of course, that alone won't sell a game ecosystem.  Nobody's going to pay to help Unreal devs be 'lazy' and have needless assets.  But maybe there are truly impressive things that could be done if the game client was larger, or if it could real-time stream things from a different part of the intranet at rates a home user wouldn't be able to.</li>
<li>Shared experiences -- Stadia hit on this a bit, but seemless software for integrating multiplayer fixes things like the need for high quality tooling on latency-heavy games.  This is dependant on latency at the user level, but you can see this use case currently playing out as members of the fighting game community, a game genre with high demands on latency, are playing games by loading up emulators on shared Parsec servers, so each player has the same latency concerns over connecting to the stream, but they know that the implementation of multiplayer is not screwing them.  Again, this is something that is partially a developer-centric sales point.</li>
